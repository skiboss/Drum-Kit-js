# Drum Kit Application

## A project to solidify understanding of JavaScript functions and methods while still playing around more conditionals like for loop and switch statement.
## I also used the Audio() methoud here to play a sound depending on the button clicked or key pressed.
## Live page at { https://skiboss.github.io/Drum-Kit-js/ }

## STEPS TO PLAY
### ___1) Clone repo
### ___2) Navigate to cloned repo directory and open the index.html in browser
### ___3) Viola! Click on any of the buttons displayed or tap the keyboard letters displayed on the buttons, it should play the sounds of the drums on the background.
