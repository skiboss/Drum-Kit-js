# Drum Kit Application

## A project to solidify understanding of JavaScript functions and methods while still playing around more conditionals like for loop and switch statement.
## I also used the Audio() methoud here to play a sound depending on the button clicked or key pressed.
## STEPS TO PLAY
### 1) Clone repo
### 2) Navigate to cloned repo directory and open the index.html in browser
### 3) Viola! Click on any of the buttons displayed or tap the keyboard letters displayed on the buttons, it should play the sounds of the drums on the background.

## Feel free to drop your suggestions [mailto:skiboss4life@gmail.com]
